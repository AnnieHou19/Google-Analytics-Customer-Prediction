# Google-Analytics-Customer-Prediction
This respiratory is to analyze Google Merchandise Store customer dataset to predict revenue per customer.
The ultimate goal of this project is to predict the sum of all transactions per user for December 1st, 2018 to January 31st, 2019. 
In every business it was proven about 80-20 rule, this rule tells us 80% of our revenue will be generated by only 20% of our potential customers. Therefore understanding who those 20% customers are is very important to GStore’s further revenue generation and success. By doing so, the GStore marketing team will be able to implement their marketing budget efficiently to reach those high value customers. The model will help GStore and it’s marketing team to make the better decisions when spending their advertising budget. Without such a model, GStore marketing team wouldn’t know the optimal way of making marketing strategies to help GStore to achieve further revenue growth.
